Class Projects

Not everything works 100%, these are all projects I completed in my CS 251 class. Some code may have been written by my instructor,
but for the most part the code is written by me. For example, before we learned how to create a GUI my instructor wrote the GUI
portion of Gomoku and we wrote the game logic. By the end of the semester we learned how to create a GUI so that does not apply 
later on. I tried my best to indicate when the code was not written by me.
